# CRAM
### Command line Rust-based Account Manager

CRAM (or cram) is a command line account management tool. It is intended to permit for local and manual management of the flow of money between users and acocunts in a similar manner to many budgeting tools.

It is currently being developed by Jordan Hay as a hobby project. In the unlikely case this project attracts anyone's interest, further development would be welcomed :) until that time it will remain a more laid back development style.
